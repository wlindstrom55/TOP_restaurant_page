# The Odin Project: Restaurant Page
    - This project will be more DOM manipulation to dynamically render a simple restaurant homepage.
    - The different tabs on the page will be separate modules bundled together by webpack!
    - Instructions here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page
    - The project requirements, aside from any styling, are done right now. I will return to this project for more CSS practice soon, at which point I plan on hosting it on Github Pages.
